Hi! My name is FÃ¡bio Cypreste. I'm 21 years old and i love technology since i remember. I'm very curious and want to know the most of the things that i like. Actually, i'm working with Cloud Computing using Huawei Cloud, but i have a passion with Cybersecurity and Game Development too.

This year (2024), i'm focusing on taking my first certify HCIA and learn more about Cloud Computing, programming languages and another tiny things.

Some of my hobbies are:
 - Play PC/Xbox (Actually liking Baldur's Gate 3, Chrono Trigger and enjoying Arena's Mode on League of Legends);
 - Gym;
 - Enjoy with my girlfriend going to shopping, watching a film in cinema or eating icecream;
 - Play and talk at Thu/Sex with my friends.

My primary language is Brazilian Portuguese (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), but i can talk in English too (ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸).
